# Navel Bacteria

## Overview

### Background
A biological researcher in a prominent microbiology lab is studying bacterial species that reside in the human navel. They are interested in discovering and documenting bacterial species that have the ability to synthesize proteins that taste like beef.

### Goal
Build a mock dashboard that both researchers and participants of this study can access.
Those who participated in the study should be able to visit a website and select their ID numbers to see which bacterial species live in their navels.
